It's a hard decision to become a SDE through self-study.
Thinking of what I have learnt in Zhejiang University, I would say probably nothing useful!
As for selecting school, I might not make the right decision : Shenzhen Experimental school and Zhejiang University.
To be honest, the quality of undergraduate education in Zhejiang University is veryvery bad, I am very  regretful now.
But in this time -the fourth year in ZJU, I have made a decision to become a SDE and I am determined.
This the first computer science course I have ever taken, from 8th April to 10th May. Just keep it on and I believe I can reach success eventually!
